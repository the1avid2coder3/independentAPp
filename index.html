        What is a balanced diet?

    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. To get the nutrition you need, most of your daily calories should come from:

fresh fruits
fresh vegetables
whole grains
legumes
nuts
lean proteins
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans explain how much of each nutrient you should consume daily.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>


    <a href="https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-7/"> <button>Dietary Guidlines for Americans</button></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Calories</h3>
    <p>
        The number of calories in a food refers to the amount of energy stored in that food. Your body uses calories from food for walking, thinking, breathing, and other important functions.

        The average person needs about 2,000 calories every day to maintain their weight, but the amount will depend on their age, sex, and physical activity level.
        
        Males tend to need more calories than females, and people who exercise need more calories than people who don’t.
        
        Current guidelinesTrusted Source list the following calorie intakes for males and females of different ages:
        
        Person	Calorie requirements
        Sedentary children: 2–8 years	1,000–1,400
        Active children: 2–8 years	1,000–2,000
        Females: 9–13 years	1,400–2,200
        Males: 9–13 years	1,600–2,600
        Active females: 14–30 years	2,400
        Sedentary females: 14–30 years	1,800–2,000
        Active males: 14–30 years	2,800–3,200
        Sedentary males: 14–30 years	2,000–2,600
        Active people: 30 years and over	2,000–3,000
        Sedentary people: 30 years and over	1,600–2,400
        The source of your daily calories are also important. Foods that provide mainly calories and very little nutrition are known as “empty calories.”
        
        Examples of foods that provide empty calories include:
        
        cakes, cookies, and donuts
        processed meats
        energy drinks and sodas
        fruit drinks with added sugar
        ice cream
        chips and fries
        pizza
        sodas
        However, it’s not only the type of food but the ingredients that make it nutritious.
        
        A homemade pizza with a wholemeal base and plenty of fresh veggies on top may be a healthy choice. In contrast, premade pizzas and other highly processed foods often contain empty calories.
        
        To maintain good health, limit your consumption of empty calories and instead try to get your calories from foods that are rich in other nutrients.

        How to Maintain a balanced diet
    </h2>
    <br>
<p>
    A healthy, balanced diet will usually include the following nutrients:

vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants
carbohydrates, including starches and fiber
protein
healthy fats
A balanced diet will include a variety of foods from the following groups:

fruits
vegetables
grains
dairy
protein foods
Examples of protein foods include meat, eggs, fish, beans, nuts, and legumes.

People who follow a vegan diet will focus entirely on plant-based foods. They won’t eat meat, fish, or dairy, but their diet will include other items that provide similar nutrients.

Tofu and beans, for example, are plant-based sources of protein. Some people are intolerant of dairy but can still build a balanced diet by choosing a variety of nutrient-rich replacements.

What’s healthy for one person may not be suitable for another.

Whole wheat flour can be a healthy ingredient for many people but isn’t suitable for those with a gluten intolerance, for example.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance.

Children who don’t get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections.

They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood.

Without exercise, they’ll also have a higher risk of obesity and various diseases that make up metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.

According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 4 of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States are directly linked to diet.

These are:

heart disease
cancer
stroke
type 2 diabetes
